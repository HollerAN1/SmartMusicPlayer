# SmartMusicPlayer

The idea behind this project is to create a music player that is "smart" in the way that it presents and plays music.
Local data is taken on the users most played songs, most skipped songs, etc. to determine which songs the user is more
likely to enjoy listening to. The end goal is to use this information to present a better listening experience to the user
where shuffling songs is no longer random but will favor those songs the user is less likely to skip and more likely to listen
through to the end. The plan is to incorporate a stats screen to display all of the data to the user at their request and allow
the user to update any information they deem incorrect.
